#### Search through your history.
There are 2 ways to search your history. In the Omnibar or through the Overview.

**Omnibar**
1. Go to the address bar of your browser
2. Type `w` + `space_bar`
3. Now simply type in your search query and the results will show below.
4. Hitting `enter` will bring you to the overview

**Overview**
1. Click on the worldbrain extension
2. In the popup under `search`, type your search query and hit enter.
3. This should bring you to the overview page

### Blacklist Sites
Have a website you don't want worldbrain to log? It's easy to choose either a whole domain or specific address.
**Note by default worldbrain doesn't run in "incognito" or "private" windows**

**For a site you are currently visiting**
1. Click the worldbrain extension
2. Click `Blacklist`
3. Choose either the whole domain or the specific url
4. It was almost too easy :tada:

**For other sites**
1. Click the worldbrain extension
2. Click on `Settings`
3. In the left menu click `Blacklist`
4. Now simply type the address you want worldbrain to ignore and click `Add to Blacklist`

### Import
Want to import all your previous history items to make searching even better?

1. Click on the worldbrain extension
2. Click `Settings`
3. Click on `Import` in the left menu
4. Check the tic box of `browsing history` and/or `bookmarks` depending on your preference.
5. Click `Start Import`
6. This could take a while.... Feel free to pause or cancel at any time
7. Please remember if you keep the tab open in the background it will still run!
