<div class="ocrtext">A full-time surgeon at King/Drew, Heard was faulted in the 1992death of Sheriff’s Deputy Nelson Yamamoto. The deputy had a better than even chance of surviving his gunshot wounds, butHeard administereda lethal combination combination of heart medications, said county prosecutors in a report issued issued three years later. The district attorney never filed charges, however, saying a jury would be unlikely to convict. Since then, Heard has been named in three other malpractice malpractice suits resulting in payouts to people he treated while moonlighting moonlighting at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.They include a$285,000 jury award in 1999 to a patient who suffered a massive infection after Heard missed a perforation in his esophagus during during surgery, court records say. Another case, whichwas settled for an undisclosed sum, also prompteda formal accusation from the Medical Board of California California in 2002. The board accused Heard of misdiagnosing a 27- year-old man with appendicitis when he actually had Crohn’s disease, an intestinal disorder. According to the board’s allegations, Heard told Brian Kelly’s family that he had removed Kelly’s appendix, and he billed the man’s insurance company for the procedure. Heard hadn’t removed the organ, however. He had stitched through Kelly’s intestinal tract, the board said, and afteran infection developed, developed, another doctor operated and found “a normal, intact appendix.” Heard has asked for a hearing to contest the board’s allegations, allegations, but declined to comment on them in an interview. In the sheriff’s deputy case, he said, the board did not pursue discipline against him after he passed an oral examination. In general, Heard acknowledged making some mistakes but said all surgeons did, especially in difficult cases. “I want you to find me a surgeon that works in a high-risk field and find one that has not had any type of adverse action against him,” he said. Dr. Jonathan Heard A26 TUESDAY,DECEMBER7,2004 LOSANGELESTIMES the rules.” Gleason-Jordan was replaced as chairwoman the month after the audit was released, and she later retired. In an interview, she defended Hooper’s Hooper’s performance and accused her former former staff of lying. Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, who became became director of the county Department Department of Health Services in early 2002, said the Hooper case was his first signal that King/Drew suffered from grave medical and management problems. “I was just struck by the nature of the errors and by the relatively casual way it was handled,” he said recently. “It was very clear to me we needed new leadership.” leadership.” Garthwaite could not explain, however, however, why he did not act against Hooper. An independent expert who reviewed reviewed the audit, the pathologists’ letter of warning and other records for The Times said Hooper’s ongoing mistakes pointed to broad failures in leadership at the hospital. “Certainly his bosses were not doing agood job in preventing these errors,” said Dr. Hector Battifora, former chairman chairman of pathology at City of Hope National National Medical Center in Duarte. “When errors like this happen and they are reported reported and nothing is done ...that is absurd. And the administration should have been aware of it, and they should have done something about it.” Dutra distinctly remembers one administrator’s administrator’s response. Anderson, the health department’s acting medical director, chastised Dutra Dutra in a letter for “releasing confidential, patient-specific information” to the medical board and Burke’s office. In the final paragraph, however, Anderson Anderson briefly commended Dutra’s concern concern for patient safety. Reexamining 2,000 diagnoses A dministrators finally did something about Hooper — after he was gone. They paid Mohamed and another pathologist thousands thousands of dollars to comb through all his nearly 2,000 diagnoses. Mohamed said she had not kept a precise tally of misread tests, but had referred cases as she found them to the hospital’s risk management department. department. She saidrecently that she could remember justone significant case beyond beyond those the hospital already knew about. According to court files, Maria Aparicio, Aparicio, now 66, learned after the review that Hooper had missed her breast cancer cancer two years earlier. Aparicio, who required required surgery and follow-up treatment, sued and collected a $25,000 settlement from the hospital. California authorities did not try to discipline Hooper until October 2003 — three years after the pathologists wrote their letter — when the state medical board accused him of mishandling the care of six King/Drew patients, including including Williams, whose reproductive organs organs were removed unnecessarily. He is contesting the board’s accusation. Dutra took no solace in his group’s ultimate vindication by county auditors. auditors. He left King/Drew in July2003, disgusted, disgusted, he said, with its leadership. “Even when you win, you don’t win anything,” anything,” he said. By the time the medical board filed its case, Hooper had left the state. Today, he is a staff pathologist at a large private hospital in San Antonio. “Dr. Hooper is a member in good standing of our medical staff here at Baptist Health System,” spokeswoman Karen May said. “And that’s the information information we’re prepared to release.” Times researcher Scott Wilson contributed contributed to this report. The Troubles at King/Drew Serious concerns, casual response [ Hospital, from Page A25 ] Robert Gauthier Los Angeles Times ADOCTOR’S DEFENDER An activist at a rally in Watts early this year carries a sign showing his support for Dr. Arthur Fleming, the ousted head of surgery at King/Drew. In fiscal 2003-04, Fleming, the hospital’s second-highest-paid staffer, earned $399,367, including an academic stipend. He quit the staff as the county tried to fire him. B RANAN was hired as a neurosurgeon at King/Drew in 2002, four months after a Colorado jury found him at fault in the care of a patient and ordered him to pay a $5.8-million $5.8-million malpractice award. It was one of the largest such verdicts in that state’s history. The patient, an inspector at a nuclear weapons plant, had become become paralyzed after Branan removed a suspicious mass from his back, the lawsuit said. After a judge reduced the jury award, Branan settled the case last year for more than $1.5 million, according to a Times analysis analysis of data from the National Practitioner Data Bank, a clearing- house for information on malpractice and discipline against doctors. Branan settled three other cases last year for $70,000 to $350,000, and one for an unspecified sum this year involving care he provided in Colorado. Branan faced other difficulties in his career:He was terminated terminated from one neurosurgical job in Colorado in 1996 and was asked to leave his physician-training program in the mid-1970s. In both cases, his difficulties arose from conflicts with other doctors, according to his own testimony in one Colorado lawsuit. lawsuit. Branan declined to comment. OTHER DOCTORS FAULTED Dr. Richard Branan By Charles Ornstein and Tracy Weber F LEMING was forced out in 2003 as chairman of the King/ Drew surgery department. Later, as the countywas attempting attempting to fire him, he resigned from the hospitalstaff. Even so, for the fiscal year ending last June, he was the second-highest-paid second-highest-paid King/Drew doctor, earning $399,367, including an academic stipend. County health officials blamed Fleming after a national accrediting accrediting group withdrew its endorsement of the surgery residency residency program in August 2003, forcing its closure last June. Separately, a 2003 county health department audit raised concerns about delays in surgeries and absenteeism among sur- gical staff. It also said that Fleming’s department made loans to physicians from surgery accounts and that it did not track whether the money was repaid. Overall, the audit said, the department’s leadership showed a“fundamental absence of administrative skills or competence.” Fleming has defended his performance, and last week referred referred a reporter to his testimony at a state Assembly hearing in September 2003. There, he said that the loss of the residency program was not his fault and that the council’s action was based on misinformation. He also said he kept his department going for years despite inadequate resourcesfrom the county. Dr. Arthur Fleming A SHLEY, an anesthesiologist, has been in charge of King/ Drew’s doctor-training programs since 2001. During her tenure, accreditors have ordered the closure of training programs in radiology, surgery and neonatology. Accreditors say King/Drew’s overall supervision of its residents ranks it among the U.S.’ worst teaching hospitals. Yet last fiscal year, Ashley was one of King/Drew’s highest- paid employees, earning $333,341, with her academic stipend. Ashley has had other troubles. In a discrimination lawsuit, lawyers for a middle-aged doctor contended that Ashley had urged his removal from a residency program because of his age, causing him to have a heart attack. In 2000, a jury ruled in the man’s favor, against King/Drew and its affiliated medical school. The county settled with his family for $3.8 million in 2002, after he had died. In 1996, the Medical Board of California gave Ashley two years’ probation for not properly supervising 14 physician assistants, assistants, including five not licensed in California. Though this involved involved private clinics, she was also working at King/Drew then. Ashley referred questions to attorney Mark Ravis. In a letter to The Times, he said that her medical board sanction resulted from a “technical violation” and that the jury’s decision in the discrimination case was wrong. Ravis praised Ashley’s accomplishments, accomplishments, saying she was eminently qualified for her position. Dr. Sharon Ashley R EED was accepted into King/Drew’s internal-medicine training program in 1998 despite admitting that he had been convicted of Medicaid fraud and, as a result, had lost his medical license in Louisiana, records show. Twenty days after Reed began his residency, in July 1998, the attorney general of Louisiana informed King/Drew’s affiliated medical school that he had “major problems” that would impair his ability to practice medicine, the school said in court records. He was fired a year later. In an interview, Reed said that he had been forthcoming with the hospital and medical school but that “they were having problems getting residents in who could pass the licensing exam, and they rushed me in because of that.” Reed said he had believed that King/Drew, when it accepted him, was giving him a second chance.
