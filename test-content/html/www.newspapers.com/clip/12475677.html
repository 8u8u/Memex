Looked at from the point of view of tho &quot;Mlttel-Europa&quot; &quot;Mlttel-Europa&quot; &quot;Mlttel-Europa&quot; scheme, the President&#039;s terms break the back of this notion by restoring Rumania and Serbia and bestowing upon the latter a sea coast, obviously in Albania. It was to break down such a barrier that Austria, at Germany&#039;s Germany&#039;s direction, assailed Serbia in July, 1914. and produced the world war. When Serbia and Rumania have been restored.

But the President does not stop there. He not only insists upon the restitution by Germany Germany and Austria of all the lands taken In t&amp;e present war. but he demands that Germany shall cede Alsace-Lorraine Alsace-Lorraine Alsace-Lorraine to France, and the Polish districts districts of Prussia to the new Poland. By these two cessions Gerwany would lose more than 12,000 square miles, and between 5.000.000 and 6.000,000 of people which were theirs before the present war.

S America&#039;s programme of war and peace, with def inite terms upon which, the nations nations great and small lighting together against German world domination are ready to lay down their arras, was given to the world by President Wilson today through an address to Congress in Joint session.

Thus he pledged the country to the Allied policy of no separate peace. &quot;Wo cannot be separated In interest or divided in purpose.&quot; he said. &quot;We etand together to the end.&quot; CHALLENGE ANSWERED. The speech, heard by Congress Congress at an hour&#039;s notice and accepted with a wave of approval approval that brought together virtually every element of both houses, was delivered as a direct direct response to the German challenge In the negotiations with the Russians at Brest-Lltovsk.

Fourteen concrete proposals laid down by the President be-Ican be-Ican be-Ican with the declaration that the days of private International understandings are gone, and that covenants of peace must be reached in the open. Briefly summarised, the other points were: Absolute freedom of the seaa in peace or war. except aa they may be closed by International action; removal of economic barriers barriers among nations associating themselves to maintain peace; guarantees of the reduction of armaments to the lowest consistent consistent point with domestic safety: safety: impartial adjustment of colonial colonial claims, based upon the principle that tho peoples concerned concerned have equal rights with the governments: evacuation of all Russian territory and opportunity opportunity for Russia&#039;s political development: development: eacuatlon of Bel-glum: Bel-glum: Bel-glum: evacuation of French territory territory and righting of the Alsace-Lorraine Alsace-Lorraine Alsace-Lorraine Alsace-Lorraine wrong: readjustment readjustment of Italy&#039;s frontiers along recognizable, lines of nationality; nationality; free opportunity for autonomous autonomous development of the peoples peoples of Austria-Hungary: Austria-Hungary: Austria-Hungary: evacuation evacuation of Rumania.

This was in line with his previous declaration that the word of the present rulers of Germany could not he taken for anything worth whlln. but he took care to disclaim, any intention to suggest a change In German institutions. Everywhere tn Washington It was agreed that the President had made a great addresa and had given expression to the views of the American people as a whole. The dtffcrer.ee of opinion was as to whether It was a peace or a war speech. Some member of both houses of Congress proteased to believe that the- the- Germans might find the terms laid down acceptable as basis of . negotiation and to hop that a bona-lido bona-lido bona-lido offer trtgf result. In most quarters however, there was no such optimism, and the speech was looked upon upon as a great war document clearing the atmosphere for th governments and peoples righting righting Germany, heartening the disorganized disorganized Russians and furnishing furnishing a light for the Gcntuut people themselves when they want to see it.

It Is felt that no efforts should be spared to prevent a resumption of th Brest-Li Brest-Li Brest-Li to vsk negotiations by the Russians, without carnet hut kindly admonition bv th Allies and America of the terrible terrible dangers to which she is exposed. Th President assumed in his message to Congress that tht negotiations have been broken off. Yet.
