On a normal night, Collis said, there are only &#039; about two to three structure fires reported an hour city wide. &quot;They&#039;re coming in about one a minute,&quot; Collis said. &quot;...

The anger over the King verdict simmered through the afternoon, then turned ugly as dusk started to fall over the city. At Parker Center, Center, a line of police in riot gear faced off against protesters gathered gathered outside. But when anarchy erupted at Florence and Norman-die Norman-die Norman-die starting at about 5:30 p.m., police were nowhere to be seen. No signs of law enforcement were evident for hours as mobs dragged motorists from their vehicles and beat them, hurled rocks and bottles at passing cars and looted a nearby liquor store. Officers responding to the violence violence retreated after the mob grew larger and angrier. The lack of response puzzled Reiner. &quot;I would have thought they would have moved in immediately and quickly suppressed it,&quot; Reiner said. &quot;The plan is a mystery to me.&quot; TV reporters also expressed disbelief disbelief at the scene unfolding live before viewers. &quot;I can&#039;t believe the cops are looking at this and not doing something, &quot;one anchorwo-man anchorwo-man anchorwo-man declared. Police initially said they lacked sufficient forces to react to some specific trouble spots. &quot;We didn&#039;t have enough numbers numbers to go in,&quot; Cmdr. Robert Gil, a police spokesman, said early in the evening. &quot;You can&#039;t go in if you have only four or five officers. You have to have a sufficient number.&quot; At about 7 p.m., as violence escalated, police commanders ordered ordered all off-duty off-duty off-duty officers to report for duty. The city&#039;s longstanding racial tensions, which many leaders have said were exacerbated by the beating beating of King, reached their hottest point on the streets following the-verdicts. the-verdicts. the-verdicts.

This is just beginning.&quot; A looter carrying beer out of a liquor store angrily compared the King verdict with that of a Korean-born Korean-born Korean-born Korean-born grocer who recently was granted probation after being convicted convicted in the shooting of a 15-year-old 15-year-old 15-year-old 15-year-old 15-year-old black girl she had accused of attempting to steal a bottle of orange juice. The four police officers &quot;should have gotten at least six months. It&#039;s not fair,&quot; he said. &quot;... They been beating us for months. What&#039;s right is right. People can&#039;t keep living like this. People are tired of this.&quot; As he spoke, a Firestone Tire Shop nearby was going up in flames.
