Times Stall Writer WASHINGTON By a vote of 52 to 48. the Senate on Wednesday cleared the way for the controversial S8.5-bilIion S8.5-bilIion S8.5-bilIion AWACS sale to Saudi Arabia, handing President Reagan a come-from-behind come-from-behind come-from-behind come-from-behind come-from-behind victory in his first major foreign policy showdown with Congress. Ending a fierce struggle that had &quot; gone on for months, the vote turned Wage Concessions Steelmaker, Union Going ThroughMill By BARRY SIEGEL. Times Staff Writer CANTON. Ohio When the Tim-ken Tim-ken Tim-ken Co. announced earlier this year it was considering building a $500-million $500-million $500-million steel mill here that would provide 1.000 new jobs, it seemed a godsend for this depressed industrial industrial area. There was just one hitch. The Timken Co. wanted the sort of contract concessions from the United Steelworkers that a number of other unions have recently been granting recession-strained recession-strained recession-strained companies companies in an effort to retain jobs and keep plants open. The company said the concessions concessions were needed to make the project economically feasible and competitive in the world market Without them. Timken might build the plant on alternative sites in Kentucky or Tennessee. County and state officials there were eagerly eagerly offering everything from tax breaks to new roads. A Second Hitch So, after negotiations, union leaders leaders here endorsed the concession package and offered it to the rank-and-file rank-and-file rank-and-file rank-and-file rank-and-file workers. Then came a second hitch. On Oct 11. workers startled Timken. Timken. government and union leaders by voting narrowly to reject the concessions. Distracted by warm fall weather and a Cleveland Browns-Pittsburgh Browns-Pittsburgh Browns-Pittsburgh Steelers football football game on television. 83 of the 9.000 union members eligible did not even bother to vote. The union rejection has left this city of 95,000 in an uproar. Community leaders, letter writers writers and local newspaper editorials have described the vote with expressions expressions such as &quot;disbelief,&quot; &quot;amazed,&quot; &quot;hard to understand.&quot; &quot;self-destructive&quot; &quot;self-destructive&quot; &quot;self-destructive&quot; and &quot;selfish tunnel tunnel vision.&quot; The steelworkers have not been very happy either.

Times Washington Bureau. Chief WASHINGTON President Reagan&#039;s Reagan&#039;s stunning victory in the Senate on the sale of AWACS radar aircraft to Saudi Arabia should strengthen his hand at home and abroad, even though he achieved it at some political political cost. At home, the victory bolstered Reagan&#039;s image as a strong leader by demonstrating once again his mastery of the legislative process and his determination to keep a promise, even when he faces what seems to be almost insurmountable opposition. Abroad, the victory should shore up U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and strengthen pro-Western pro-Western pro-Western elements elements in the Saudi ruling family, who favor the continued high levels of oil production that are important for the U.S. economy as well as its security. back a bid by opponents of the sale to veto an agreement concluded between between the Reagan Administration and the Saudi government last February. February. Four senators who had opposed the sale Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.). (R-Wash.). (R-Wash.). Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.). (R-Me.). (R-Me.). Sen. Mark Andrews (R-N.D.) (R-N.D.) (R-N.D.) and Sen. Edward Zorinsky CD-Neb, CD-Neb, CD-Neb, (switched sides during the final debate, two of them on the roll-call roll-call roll-call vote, to give the President his victory. Until this week, the Senate had appeared certain to veto the transaction transaction and block a presidential arms sale for the first time in history. Breakdown by Party However, the President carried the day when 41 Republicans. 10 Democrats and Independent Harry F. Byrd of Virginia voted to kill a resolution that would have disapproved disapproved the sale. Voting for the resolution resolution were 36 Democrats and 12 Republicans. California&#039;s senators split on the issue, with Republican S. I. Hayakawa supporting the President and Democrat Alan Cranston Cranston opposing him. The House voted. 301 to 111. two weeks ago to disapprove the sale, but both houses of Congress must reject proposed arms sales before they are dead. The White House managed to reverse reverse the votes of several opposing Republican senators and save the agreement Wednesday by sending Congress a five-page five-page five-page letter of assurances assurances regarding sale of the five airborne warning and control system system planes to the Saudis. The letter went beyond the language of the official official agreement itself. In recent days, the President had given top priority to personal appeals appeals to senators, arguing that de- de- Text of Reagan letter. Page 11. Other stories.

Opponents of the salefnaintained to the end that it would accelerate the arms race in the volatile Middle East, undermine the security of Israel Israel and jeopardize the security of sophisticated military technology by putting it into the hands of a potentially unstable government in Saudi Arabia. Minutes after the vote, the President President took the first step in what is expected to be a concerted effort to reassure Israel that the present relationship relationship between the two countries countries will remain the keystone of U.S. Middle East policy. Please see AWACS, Page 6 But Administration officials recognize recognize that in the end they may have to pay for their victory. A White House aide, suggesting that the wounds inflicted at home and abroad might be a long time healing, healing, said. &quot;A win is better than a loss, but there is blood all over the floor.&quot; In forcing the issue on the sale despite heavy opposition, the Administration Administration rolled over some Republicans Republicans as well as Democrats in the Senate and antagonized the American Jewish community, which fought the deal to the bitter end. A leading Jewish lobbyist in Washington, who declined to be identified, said he expects the Jewish Jewish community to react bitterly against Reagan, but added, &quot;A lot Please see REAGAN, Page 12 Dodger players rejoice over winning the World Series by beating Yankees, 9-2, 9-2, 9-2, in sixth game in Last-Minute Last-Minute Last-Minute Letter Sews Up Vote in Senate By GEORGE SKELTON and PAUL HOUSTON, Times Staff Writers WASHINGTON A last-minute last-minute last-minute letter from President Reagan spelling spelling out guarantees to keep AWACS radar surveillance planes from being being used against Israel or falling into enemy hands was the final maneuver that sewed up the President&#039;s President&#039;s dramatic victory in the Senate Senate on Wednesday. But what really spelled victory for the White House was a combination combination of Reagan charm and old-fashioned old-fashioned old-fashioned pressure politics a combination combination Reagan has used several times before in such legislative fights. As Reagan is fond of saying, he first tries to help legislators &quot;see the light.&quot; And if they don&#039;t, he says, &quot;we make them feel the heat.&quot; One of those who felt the heat was Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.). (D-Ark.). (D-Ark.).
