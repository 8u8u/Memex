By DAVID FERRELL andSHERYLSTOLBERG TIMES STAFF WRITERS &quot; And then night fell. ..The screaming sirens and staccato staccato din of television helicopters had all but disappeared. Burned-out Burned-out Burned-out cars and buckled freeways lay silent. Homes lay in ruins. All that initial upheaval had subsided, leaving leaving the city to bed down under curfew, on edge, alone in the dark. j After a day of catastrophe, many in Los Angeles worked their own twist, on the words of the poet Dylan Thomas: They did not go gently. , Rather, they entered a night of uncommon trepidation. They found themseives confronting demons both real and imagined. In the long hours before dawn, weary residents residents tried to find rest, sometimes amid homelessness and despair. All the while, they wondered if the darkness which had delivered Monday&#039;s temblor would strike again. &quot;The day is more easy,&quot; said Zoila Zuleta, who along with her three children curled up on flattened flattened cardboard boxes in the parking lot of a Lucky supermarket supermarket in Sepulveda. &quot;The night. . . ,&quot; her voice drifted off. &quot;The night is awful.&quot; . Some left homeless huddled under under blankets in store parking lots. Others slept in their own homes, but with one eye open, removing the mirror from above the dresser, wrapping the favorite vase in towels, towels, putting the running shoes by the bed just in case. In Woodland Hills, shaken residents fought fears of the night in grand style: They threw a block party. Thousands camped out in parks, unwilling or unable to go home.

By HENRY WEINSTEIN and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, times staff writers As waves of aftershocks continued to jolt quake-ravaged quake-ravaged quake-ravaged Southern California, life was anything but back to normal Tuesday for vast swaths of the region, which was struggling to xlig out from the rubble, maneuver over a crumpled freeway system and assess the devastation without full benefit of power, gas or phones. . -. -. v A day after a magnitude 6.6 earthquake rumbled violently under under the San Fernando Valley, tens of thousands of frazzled and displaced displaced residents turned their neighborhoods into sprawling campgrounds, burning tree limbs for warmth, boiling water against contaminants, stocking up on batteries batteries and wondering when or if they will be able to return home. &quot;At least if I die here, they&#039;ll find me quick and not have to search for me in the rubble,&quot; said Silvia Martinez, 25, who was camped out , at Echo Park Lake, where she had set up a frayed mattress under a makeshift tent of black garbage bags strung between two shopping carts. The day&#039;s major developments: The death toll climbed to 40. Among the latest fatalities was the 16th body to be pulled from the three-story three-story three-story Northridge Meadows apartments, which became the focus focus of a grim rescue mission after it collapsed into two floors. Four other deaths in the latest tally were attributed to heart attacks. One other died in a traffic accident on Monday.
