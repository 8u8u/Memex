<div class="ocrtext">RIOTS: Troops Take to the Streets; Residents Begin the Cleanup Continued from A10 hard-hit hard-hit hard-hit by rioters: All but two of the city&#039;s dozen or so grocery stores had been reduced to ashes. At first, residents greeted the Marine landing stonily, partly because because many people in Compton had become used to the sight of National National Guard forces patrolling their ravaged neighborhood. The Marines Marines were dressed in nearly identical identical fatigues and carried the same M-16 M-16 M-16 rifles, making it impossible for most people to distinguish from the Guard forces at first glance. But as residents figured out the new arrivals were from Camp Pendleton, Pendleton, many said they were pleased that the government would go to such lengths to protect them. &quot;I think it&#039;s beautiful. I really do,&quot; said Cynthia Ricks, 33, a Compton mother of four. &quot;This is respect to me.&quot; The Marines accepted their duty stoically. &quot;I&#039;d rather be home with my wife right now,&quot; said Lance Corp. David Shaw, a 20-ycar-old 20-ycar-old 20-ycar-old 20-ycar-old 20-ycar-old Marine who stood grimly surveying the Compton neighborhood. &quot;But I&#039;m more than happy to be here to try and keep the peace.&quot; Military commanders and city officials characterized the troop movement as merely an effort to relieve weary National Guard, some of whom had been on duty for more than 24 hours. But it also represented the first landing of active duty federal troops inside the city, a move local officials had hoped to avoid. In a news conference Friday, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates had expressed misgivings about bringing bringing in federal troops, saying it was something that &quot;goes against my grain.&quot; But Maj. Gen. Marvin L. Covault, the commanding general of the Los Angeles forces, said he had spoken with Gates and Sheriff Sherman Block about the deployment plan. All three officials had &quot;a meeting of the minds,&quot; Covault said. LAPD and the Sheriff&#039;s Department Department made requests for the soldiers soldiers at specific locations, and military military commanders passed those orders to their troops. For the most part, the military forces replaced Guard units, so the overall size of the federal presence in Los Angeles Angeles was not changed markedly by their arrival. &quot;They will operate on shifts,&quot; The Toll Asoj 0 p.m. Saturday, authorities reported the following tallies: Deaths: 45 Injuries: 2,116, including 211 critical Fires: 5,534 responses, including multiple calls to various locations Arrests: 7,495 National Guard: 7,742 CHP deployment: 750 Federal agencies deployment: 1,545, including 250 FBI Firefighter deployment: 3,350 Estimate of damage: $550 million, according to mayor&#039;s office; 5,000 buildings damaged or destroyed, including at least 1,600 severely damaged or burned businesses; 3,100 businesses affected by rioting or looting Covault said. &quot;As we rotate those shifts, some active duty component soldiers will take on some jobs being done by National Guard.&quot; On the street, Guard units awaiting awaiting relief were holding their positions positions after long stretches. In some areas, appreciative residents tried to make their wait easier. At 82nd and Broadway, part of the ravaged mid-section mid-section mid-section of South Los Angeles, National Guard Sgt. Jay Clark of Porterville was loaded down with equipment in the afternoon afternoon heat. Sympathetic residents supplied him and his unit with homemade lemonade, food and chairs. One store owner let the Guards use the bathroom in his carburetor shop. &quot;The people are glad to be getting getting their communities back,&quot; Clark said. &quot;They&#039;re coming up and saying: &#039;God Bless you. We&#039;re glad you&#039;re here.&#039; &quot; In more than two days of duty on the Los Angeles streets, no member member of the Guard has fired a weapon, officials said. &quot;We&#039;ve been very fortunate,&quot; said Maj. Pat Anlosh, a spokeswoman spokeswoman for the Guard. &quot;This is something that we trained for, and we&#039;re doing it professionally.&quot; Although some mix-ups mix-ups mix-ups delayed the Guard deployment at first, those problems seemed to have been cleared up by early Saturday, when more than 3,500 Guard troops were on the streets. Another 1.000 were in staging areas awaiting awaiting orders from the local authorities, authorities, but most of the looting and fires had subsided by then. Military analysts, who warned against moving troops into the city unless new violence warranted it, applauded the decision to add soldiers soldiers slowly and only as replacements. replacements. &quot;Using active duty federal troops is the last thing you want to do,&quot; said William Taylor, a military analyst and retired Army colonel. &quot;What&#039; you want to do is let the Guard control the situation and then turn it back to the police.&quot; While the Army and Marine forces remained in staging areas early Saturday, the White House said the decision not to deploy them into Los Angeles immediately immediately had been made by their field commander, who believed such a move was not yet necessary. Senior Administration officials had said late Friday after President Bush ordered the troops into action that the soldiers and Marines would move onto the city&#039;s streets overnight to establish a powerful visual presence. But a White House official stressed Saturday that the tactical decision had been delegated to Covault and that he had decided to postpone such a move. &quot;We had been under the understanding understanding that they would be on the streets by morning,&quot; the official said. &quot;But they assessed it on site and made the decision that for the time being the National Guard would be sufficient.&quot; The official said Bush, who is spending the weekend at his mountain retreat in Camp David, was being apprised of events through periodic reports from the White House Situation Room and was in full agreement with that decision. The Continuing Toll The number of killings slowed dramatically Saturday as only two more people were killed in riot-related riot-related riot-related riot-related cases. A 43-year-old 43-year-old 43-year-old 43-year-old 43-year-old black woman was killed in a hit-and-run hit-and-run hit-and-run hit-and-run hit-and-run traffic accident accident near the Harbor Freeway and Slauson Avenue early Saturday, Also contributing to tooay&#039;s coverage are Eric Bailey, James Bates, Leslie Berger, Greg Braxton, Stephanie Chavez, Rich Connell, Tina Daunt, Tammerlln Drummond, Petula Dvorak, Paul Feldman, Andrea Ford, David Freed, Mary Lou Fulton, Laura Galloway, Steve Harvey, George Hatch, Nleson Hlmmel, Bernlce Hlrabayashl, Sherry Joe, Ted Johnson, Amy Louise Kazmin, Roxana Kopetman, Greg Krikorlan, Patrick Lee, Hugo Martin, Josh Meyer, Michael Meyers, Fred Mulr, Jim Newton, Lisa Omphroy, Psyche Pascual, Mark Platte, Bob Pool, Cecilia Rasmussen, Kenneth Reich, Carla Rivera, Ron Russell, D&#039;Jamlla Salem, John Schwada, Stuart Sllversteln, George Skelton, Sheryl Stolberg, Vlckl Torres, Mike Utley, Henry Welnsteln, Tracy Wood, Eric Young and Nora Zamlchow. and in the late afternoon the coroner coroner reported an additional homicide homicide was being investigated as related to the rioting. No details about the time, place, age or race were available from authorities. But the official death toll increased increased by five Saturday as the coroner&#039;s office learned of deaths that had taken days or hours to be reported because of slow communications communications and the sheer volume of fatalities. Among the latest cases to come to light was that of Kevin Evana-hen, Evana-hen, Evana-hen, 24, who died shortly after 1 a.m. Friday while trying to put out fire at a check-cashing check-cashing check-cashing store at Bradock Street and Inglewood Boulevard in Inglewood. The grim count in Los Angeles reveals that most fatalities were caused by rioters inflicting harm on one another and innocent members members of the community. Of the 45 dead, 11 died in encounters encounters with police, including three who died in a car wreck Wednesday night after being chased by Beverly Hills police. At least 24 of the other killings were by gunshot, while four were found burned to death in charred buildings buildings that dot the city, one woman was stabbed, one woman was killed in a hit-and-run hit-and-run hit-and-run hit-and-run hit-and-run accident and one 68-year-old 68-year-old 68-year-old 68-year-old 68-year-old man was strangled at a looting scene at dusk on Thursday. Thursday. By Saturday morning, the Department Department of Water and Power, working under police protection, had restored power to half of the 25,000 residents without electricity. electricity. The RTD is to resume full service in every part of the city Sunday morning. The mayor&#039;s office reported Saturday Saturday that since the riot began, 5,000 buildings have been damaged or destroyed by fire or other vandalism vandalism at a total cost in excess of $550 million. Bradley signed an executive order order prohibiting landlords from imposing imposing late fees on renters who are unable to withdraw money from damaged banks and has instructed city Building and Safety officials to expedite reconstruction permits. The citywide damage total of $550 million was estimated by a team of building and safety officials who flew over the burned buildings. buildings. It is based on structural damage and does not include content content loss, the mayor&#039;s office said. In Long Beach, which was also pummeled and charred by rioters, the peace seemed to be restored Saturday although a late-night late-night late-night fire was reported near downtown. But the quiet came only after a massive show of force by authorities. In an emergency meeting of the Long Beach City Council on Saturday Saturday morning, officials reported that one person had died and 334 people had been injured in the rioting. The injured included 16 police or fire personnel and 21 civilians who were hospitalized in critical condition. condition. With almost 300 businesses destroyed destroyed by fire, hundreds of city employees, residents and merchants merchants began the grim cleanup of Long Beach, moving in sweeps along its major commercial streets like Pacific Coast Highway, and Atlantic and Long Beach boulevards. boulevards. In South Los Angeles, police took no chances. Two blocks surrounding surrounding the 77th Street station were cordoned off by officers armed with automatic rifles. There were bureaucratic clashes, clashes, too. In downtown Los Angeles, officials from the U.S. Justice Department Department locked horns with several several LAPD officers over the arrest of 30 students at 3rd Street and Broadway. Two racial conciliators working for Justice Department&#039;s Commu nity Relations Service asked police not to arrest the students, who had come downtown for a rally that was later canceled. Police arrested the students for failure to disperse on police order, but the arrests were held up for 15 minutes while conciliator Vermont McKinney, a former Los Angeles high school basketball star and community organizer, organizer, argued with an LAPD commander and sergeant. McKinney contended that the students members of a multiracial multiracial coalition organized by the First AME Church in South Los Angeleshad Angeleshad not gotten word that the demonstration was called off. The students also did not understand that the police order to disperse meant they had to go home, he said. As the students were taken away by police, some shouted in protest, &quot;No justice! No peace!&quot; and &quot;No justice under fascism!&quot; Others accused the LAPD of &quot;fascism&quot; and &quot;apartheid.&quot; The relative calm allowed officers officers from the LAPD to shift gears Saturday, once again focusing on serving their community as well as protecting it. They kept children out of buildings ready to collapse, guarded DWP workers trying to restore service and simply talked to residents again. &quot;I feel a lot calmer about everything,&quot; everything,&quot; said Officer Vince Aguirre, 29, a narcotics officer from the San Fernando Valley, who was standing standing guard over DWP workers. &quot;I had a van pull up and give us some Cokes. It was really nice. After the past few days, you expect trouble when a van pulls up.&quot; In the checkerboard landscape of blackened, boarded up buildings in South Los Angeles, Cmdr. Ron Banks who had become an officer in Watts just a year after the 1965 riots could see a future of rebuilding rebuilding relations with the community community all over again. The matter-of-fact matter-of-fact matter-of-fact matter-of-fact matter-of-fact words he spoke could not fully convey the mask of sadness on his face. &quot;The first two days stretched us to our limits, emotionally and otherwise,&quot; otherwise,&quot; he said. &quot;But our job probably has just begun. We&#039;ve got to put it back together now.&quot; Contributing to this story were staff writers Dean E. Murphy, Laurie Beck-lund Beck-lund Beck-lund and Amy Wallace.</div>
