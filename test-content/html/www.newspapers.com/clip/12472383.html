The cause of death was not disclosed, but Moore had been in frail health for several years. Suffering Suffering from arthritis and diabetes, he was confined to a wheelchair. In his youth in the 1930s, Moore&#039;s work was inventive and controversial. controversial. His use of biomorphic kidney-shaped kidney-shaped kidney-shaped kidney-shaped forms suggesting human human figures with holes drilled through them seemed grotesque and became the prototype for cartoons cartoons satirizing &quot;modern art.&quot; Meantime critics, connoisseurs and fellow artists held Moore in the highest esteem, regarding him as a protean giant who had single-handedly single-handedly single-handedly rescued 20th-century 20th-century 20th-century sculpture from mediocrity in much the same way that Augustc Rodin had revitalized the form in the 19th Century. Like Rodin, Moore was so popular in the United States that and, below, the falling Aeromexico jetliner after the collision. insiders joked about which of them was the greatest &quot;American&quot; sculptor. Moore, like other pioneer artists with long and productive careers, eventually became such a pillar of the establishment that the avant-garde avant-garde avant-garde came to regard him as an irrelevant maker of gigantic institutional institutional &quot;hood ornaments&quot; for corporate corporate plazas and entrances to cultural cathedrals. Dozens of public public commissions were accorded Moore, who was a tireless worker even as his health began to fade in his 70s. His best known works arc massive massive outdoor sculptures, such as a bronze figure 30 feet wide and 1G feel tall in the reflecting pool at New York&#039;s Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and the immense, rather over-scaled over-scaled over-scaled &quot;Knife Edge Two Figures&quot; punctuating the facade facade of the National Gallcrys East Building in Washington.

The crash occurred at 11:55 a.m., , and authorities identified the downed airliner as Aeromexico Flight 498, which was about to land at Los Angeles International Airport Airport after a flight from Mexico City with stops in Guadalajara, Loreto and Tijuana.

Eyewitnesses&#039; Accounts The cause of the disaster was not immediately determined, but eyewitnesses eyewitnesses said they saw the smaller airplane crash into the tail section of the jetliner. Airline spokesman Guy Arriola said 58 passengers and six crew members were aboard the DC-9 DC-9 DC-9 when it went down about 20 miles cast of the airport.
