With the jury unable to reach a consensus, a mistrial was declared on that count by Judge Stanley M.Weisberg. Except for the single deadlocked count, all four defendants, who are white, were acquitted on all counts. The unresolved count is an assault charge against Powell; prosecutors will announce May 15 whether they will retry the officer. Upon hearing the verdicts, Bri-seno Bri-seno Bri-seno who had testified that he believed his fellow officers were &quot;out of control&quot; when they beat and stomped King leaped to his feet and hugged his attorney. Powell Powell and his attorney, Michael Stone, hugged each other. &quot;I&#039;m very happy,&quot; Powell told reporters. &quot;But it&#039;s hard to be surprised. I felt all along that I was innocent. Now I know I&#039;m innocent.&quot; innocent.&quot; Attorney Darryl Mounger, who defended Koon, said he believed the verdict turned on &quot;truth.&quot; &quot;He Koon wasn&#039;t doing anything anything but making an arrest.&quot; Mounger added that the trial represented a &quot;no-win&quot; &quot;no-win&quot; &quot;no-win&quot; situation for all concerned. &quot;Nobody wins,&quot; he said. &quot;These officers have been punished enough.

NIGHTMARE Scenes of the violence that followed the acquittals of officers officers in the Rodney G. King beating case. B2 geant. Powell was greeted by a similar crowd that hurled rocks at him as he left. The prosecutors, who had stared silently at their table during the reading of the verdicts, hung their heads and marched out of the courtroom. &quot;My reaction is shock first, then disappointment,&quot; said Deputy Dist. Atty. Terry White, the lead prosecutor prosecutor in the case. &quot;Obviously we feel the evidence warranted a conviction conviction of the defendants and the jury disagreed with us. &quot; The defense strategy turned on persuading the jury that King was a combative suspect who did not comply with officers&#039; orders. Evidently, Evidently, it worked. &quot;He refused to get out of the car,&quot; said one juror who was interviewed interviewed by The Times. &quot;His two companions got out of the car and complied with all the orders and he just continued to fight. So the Police Department had no alternative. alternative. He was obviously a dangerous person. . . . Mr. King was controlling controlling the whole show with his actions.&quot; Extraordinary secrecy measures surrounded the jury, which was sequestered throughout its deliberations. deliberations. Members refused to talk to reporters after the verdicts were read in a packed, silent courtroom at the East County Courthouse. &quot;This experience has been an extremely difficult and stressful one, one that we have all agonized over a great deal,&quot; said a statement prepared by the jury forewoman, a 64-year-old 64-year-old 64-year-old 64-year-old 64-year-old military contracts manager. &quot;We feel we have done the best job we could have done.&quot; The statement was read by a court official after the jurors were whisked away in a Ventura County Sheriff&#039;s Department bus to a nearby nearby Travelodge where they had been sequestered during their deliberations. deliberations. There, they were escorted escorted to pick up their bags, some of which had masking tape placed on tags to conceal their names and addresses. The four defendants were ac- ac- The Rodney G.King Beating continued from previous page tuedj Snapshots off Key Who: Stanley M.

Served tor 18 years as a deputy district attorney for Los Angeles County. He was made a Municipal Court judge in 1986 and elevated to the Superior Court bench two years later. Compiled by Times researcher Cecilia Rasmussen quitted on one count of assault with a deadly weapon. All except Powell were acquitted of assault under the color of authority; the jury deadlocked deadlocked 8 to 4 favoring acquittal on this count for Powell. He may face a new trial on that count. Powell and Koon were acquitted of filing a false police report. Koon also was found not guilty of acting as an accessory after the fact. King&#039;s attorney, Steve Lerman, was furious with the verdicts. &quot;It says it&#039;s OK to beat somebody on the ground and beat the crap out of him,&quot; Lerman said. &quot;They the jurors chose to ignore and disregard disregard the fundamental issue: The issue of brutal, vicious felonious assault against this man. There is nothing Rodney King did to deserve deserve this fate, and the defendants defendants are walking out as heroes. &quot;The fact- fact- that maybe 12 white jurors are not going to convict four white cops, it may be as basic as that.&quot; The officers&#039; legal troubles are not over, however. A federal civil rights investigation, which had been put on hold pending the trial&#039;s outcome, will be reactivated, U.S. Atty. Lourdes G. Baird said. Elsewhere in the country, there was a similar outpouring of anger. &quot;I am shocked, outraged and frightened for our nation,&quot; said Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. &quot;We all cried and prayed for our nation. . . .Even in Johannesburg,-South Johannesburg,-South Johannesburg,-South Africa, they have begun to punish white officers officers who assault black people.&quot; Lowery planned to hold a prayer vigil at Martin Luther King Jr.&#039;s tomb in Atlanta today. The King beating quickly became became a watershed event in Los Angeles history, spawning an unprecedented unprecedented move to reform the Police Department, hastening the retirement of one chief and the hiring of another and forcing this ethnically diverse city into profound profound introspection on the state of race relations. With tensions running high after the beating, a blue-ribbon blue-ribbon blue-ribbon panel was formed to investigate the Police Police Department. Named the Christopher Christopher Commission for its chairman, chairman, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Christopher, the panel found a police force plagued by tacitly condoned racism and abuse at the hands of rogue cops. The commission called on Chief Daryl P. Gates to step down. After Wednesday&#039;s verdicts. Gates met with reporters at Parker Center but declined to express his opinion about the jury&#039;s verdict. &quot;An awful lot of people will voice their opinion,&quot; Gates said. &quot;I don&#039;t intend to.&quot; Gates directed much of his news conference to urge calm in the city. But even as he spoke, a crowd gathered in front of Parker Center. As Gates left the room, demonstrators demonstrators were shouting &quot;LAPD are rednecks! LAPD are racists!&quot; &quot;This may be a test,&quot; Gates said. cover vice officer after picking up a transvestite prostitute in Hollywood. Hollywood.

Public, Parochial Classes Canceled By RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITER Classes were canceled today for thousands of students attending dozens of schools operated by the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Compton Unified School District and the Los Angeles Archdiocese because of fears for the safety of children, school officials said. All campuses were shut down in 30-square-mile 30-square-mile 30-square-mile 30-square-mile 30-square-mile area bordered on the north by Adams Boulevard, on the west by La Cienega Boulevard, on the south by Imperial Highway and the east by Alameda Street, Warren Furatani, president of the Los Angeles Unified School District board said late Wednesday. The archdiocese closed schools in the same vicinity between Central Avenue and La Cienega. All schools in the Compton district were shut down. Los Angeles school officials were monitoring the spread of the violence to determine if more &quot;I believe people will meet that test.&quot; Later, as violence spread through parts of the city, Gates activated the LAPD Emergency Command Center, canceled police leaves and declared a permanent alert. Gates&#039; designated successor, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Willie L. Williams, who is black, was monitoring the riots on television television at his Philadelphia home. &quot;The outbursts by these people are certainly in no way helping the healing process. It&#039;s making it very difficult for those people who were trying to take this court decision and make changes. &quot;It&#039;s a no-win no-win no-win situation, everything everything that occurred in the last few hours, the rioting, the fires, the shooting death. &quot;They are going to solidify the views of those people who are not wanting to see things smoothed over, but want them further divided.&quot; divided.&quot; He declined to comment on the LAPD&#039;s tactics of holding back during the early stages of the rioting, but said he will review it when he takes office in several weeks.

The key factor, they agreed, was the change of venue granted to the defense.

There, he was ordered ordered out of his car, and the beating followed. &quot;I tried to put them in the shoes of the police officers,&quot; said Stone, &quot;and I think I was able to do that. We got the jurors to look at the case not from the eye of the camera or the eye of a video cameraman, but from the eyes of the officers who were out there that night.&quot; Powell is the officer seen leveling leveling most of the blows at King, who was swung at more than 50 times and stung by an electrical Taser gun. In speaking to reporters, Powell directed some of his wrath at Gates. &quot;He should have backed us up,&quot; Powell said. &quot;He should have backed up his policies,&quot; but the verdicts &quot;show that he was wrong.&quot; The jury heard 29 days of testimony testimony from 55 witnesses and was shown the videotape on numerous occasions.

I&#039;m ashamed to be from Los Angeles. I&#039;m happy I don&#039;t have a uniform anymore. &quot;I feel like I did when I heard that Martin Luther King died,&quot; added Coleman, who is black. &quot;I felt each of those not guiltys each one of them.&quot; A white bus driver in the San Fernando Valley, who asked that his name not be used, had a similar reaction. &quot;It&#039;s the worst thing that has happened in this nation since Kennedy Kennedy was shot in &#039;63,&quot; he said. &quot;Those guys are as guilty as guilty can be.
