California institute of Technology Technology physicists aided in the work. &quot;We have been sworn to se crecy,&quot; said Crosby, &quot;and it Isn&#039;t my purpose now to discuss any of the methods used In extract ing the atomic energy from uranium. uranium. I see no reason, however, not to say that in our detonation detonation tests, made In desert country country not far from Los Angeles, the explosion of a pea-size pea-size pea-size amount created a hole In the des ert big enough to drop In large-size large-size large-size house. &quot;Workers had to use tongs 10 feet long In&#039; extracting the energy energy from uranium. It Is taken at extremely high temperature. An unusuauy large amount of materials materials has to be used to extract a very small amount of the en ergy. Long and painstaking work went into perfecting a container for the explosive. Eventually we were, preempted; we were sworn to secrecy and that was the last of the project so far as we were concerned.&quot; B 29 s Pound Man&#039;s Most Destructive Navy Arsenal on Honshu New Raid Follows Wiping Out of Jap &#039;Mystery Town&#039; GUAM, Aug. 7. (II.E) A force of 125 B-29&#039;s B-29&#039;s B-29&#039;s attacked the Toyokawa naval arsenal on Honshu Island with high explosive bombs at noon today, today, Gen. Carl A. Spaatz announced. announced. The raid followed two days of heavy aerial blows, one of which wiped out a Japanese &quot;mystery town&quot; Sunday In what may have been an attack on new-ly new-ly new-ly developed Japanese rocket- rocket- launching installations. With long-range long-range long-range fighters from Iwo Jima as escorts, the Super fortresses hit Toyokawa, one of lapan&#039;s few remaining arsenals, for the first time. It Is on the South-Central South-Central South-Central Honshu coast, 85 miles southeast of Nagoya.

Force, One Equal to 2000 B-29 B-29 B-29 Loads, Blasts Nips WASHINGTON, Aug. 6. (P) The most terrible destructive force ever harnessed by man atomic energy released by the disintegration of jjranium is now being turned on the islands of Japan by United States bombers. The Japanese face a threat of utter desolation and their capitulation may be greatly speeded up. Existence of the great new weapon was announced personally by President Truman in a statement issued through the White House today. He said the first atomic bomb, invented and perfected in the United States, had been dropped on the Japanese army base of Hiroshima 16 hours before. v Hiro shima is on the main Japanese island of Honshu, 450 miles west of Tokyo. New Ultimatum May Follow Atom Bomb LONDON, Aug. 6. Pl The London DSHy Mall said today In a Washington dis-patch dis-patch dis-patch quoting &quot;reliable sources&quot; that Japan would he served with a new ultimatum ultimatum to surrender within 48 hours or face obliteration from the atomic bomb. The Dally Mall said the ultimatum will say: &quot;We will withhold use of the atomic bomb for 48 hours, In which time you can surrender. surrender. Otherwise you face the prospect of the entire obliteration of the Japanese nation.&quot; Four Bandits Beat and Rob Actor Louis Adlon, film player and brother-in-law brother-in-law brother-in-law brother-in-law brother-in-law of Marlon Uavies, former film star, was robbed ol $180 cash and $2500 In Jewelry early yesterday by four bandits who forced his car to the curb on the Sunset Strip and then beat him severely about the face and head. Adlon, husband of Rose Davles, had Just left a party at a near-by near-by near-by apartment house and was driving to his home at 321 Ocean Front, Santa Monica, when the attack occurred.

Atom-Splitting Atom-Splitting Atom-Splitting Test by Science Group Disclosed WASHINGTON. Aue. 8. OJ.R) In a New Mexico desert wilderness wilderness 120 miles from Albuquerque, a steel tower poked like a giant finger through the predawn dark ness last July to. Two &#039; groups of scientists a dozen men In alt huddled silent ly In a pouring rain. Their anxious eyes were fixed In the direction of the tower 10,000 yards distant from one group; 17,000 yards from the other. On the tower hung perhaps the fate of a nation Japan&#039;s. From it was suspended an atomic bomb an object repre senllng a $2,000,000,000 invest ment and three years of effort by the finest scientific brains which the United States and Britain could muster. Flash Blinding Maj. Gen. Islle R. Groves one of the scientists, looked at his watch. The seconds ticked off. He ordered his colleagues to lie down with their feet facing tne tower, men, at precisely o.w a.m., ne gave tne signal. There was a blinding flash. Tne dark wilderness was no longer dark. It seemed as If a million daz zling floodlights had been turned on. The blinding brilliance was brighter than the brightest daylight. daylight. A mountain range three miles from Groves&#039; observation post stood out in bold relief Ball of Fire Rises A giant ball of fire issued from the tower. &quot;We all rolled over and looked through dark glasses at the ball of fire,&quot; Groves recalled. About 40 seconds later, there came a . tremendous sustained roar and a heavy pressure wave that knocked over two men out side the control station 10,000 yards away. A blast like a heavy clap of thunder rocked an area 300 miles In diameter. Residents of a dozen towns and isolated spots as much as Turn to Page 2, Column 4 JAP BROADCAST NOTES TRUMAN ANNOUNCEMENT SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 6. (VP) The Japanese Domel Agency noted in a broadcast tonight that President Trumnn had announced announced the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. - It was the first Japanese reference reference to the new type of bomb and the broadcast, recorded by the Federal Communications Commission, made no comment on Its effects. Earlier the Osaka radio announced announced the cancellation of various various trains In Hiroshima Prefecture. Prefecture. This broadcast did not refer to the atomic bomb. &#039; Other earlier Japanese broad casts reported only that Hiro shima, tjouinwestern Honshu army center, had been raided by &quot;a small number&quot; of American B-20&#039;s B-20&#039;s B-20&#039;s with incendiaries and ex plosives at 8:20 a.m. Monday (To- (To- xyo time.) A dm. Kichisaburo Nomura, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States at the time of Pearl Harbor, was quoted In a Dome! Agency dispatch as de claring that the three -power -power Potsdam ultimatum to Nippon to surrender or be destroyed was &quot;tne neignt or imperil nonce. Nomura spoke before the un leashing by the United States of us new devastating weanon which President Truman noted had been used only after rejec-l rejec-l rejec-l uon ox uie roisaam ultimatum. That one bomb alone carried an explosion more violent than 2000 B-29 B-29 B-29 Superfortresses normally could carry to an enemy city using old type TNT bombs. Secretary of War Stlmson followed through with a report that the blast stirred a cloud of smoke and dust over Hiroshima Hiroshima so Impenetrable as to make immediate, accurate observation observation of results Impossible. The power of the bomb, Stlm son said, Is such as to &quot;stagger the Imagination.&quot; He assert ed It would, &quot;prove a tremendous aid&quot; In shortening the Japanese war. Old Speculation on Air Attacks Revived Stlmson&#039;s emphasis on this point renewed speculation all over again as to whether Japan may be completely crushed by air attack without Invasion. Mr. Truman noted that he Japanese refected the sur render ultimatum from Potsdam, and that this had been Intended to spare the Japanese people from &quot;utter destruction.&quot; destruction.&quot; Now, he said, with the new bomb, the Japanese &quot;may- &quot;may- expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth.&quot; The announcement heralded an Anglo-American Anglo-American Anglo-American victory at&#039; a cost of $2,000,000,000 In one of the grimmest battles of the war the battle of the laboratories to unlock the secrets of the atom and yoke Its energies to military use. The Germans were striving desperately to win this highly secret contest in the closing months of the European strug-: strug-: strug-: gle. New Epoch Seen for War and Peace Scientists agreed that a new epoch In both war and peadei probably Is at hand. Although much experimenting remains&#039; to be done, this newly controlled energy doubtless can bet used also to drive rockets, planes, ships and trains for con-structlve con-structlve con-structlve as well as destructive purposes. President Truman said the new bomb, which draws Its en- en- ergy from the same sources as the sun, has more power than 20,000 tons of T N T, Itself a tremendously powerful explosive. explosive. Since one B-29 B-29 B-29 ordinarily can deliver about 10 tons q&#039;f bombs to a target, that means that 2000 Superfortresses would be required to accomplish with TNT the destruction that one plane with one of these new bombs can achieve. By another standard, Mr. Truman declared the bomb has 2000 times the blast power of the llrton British &quot;Grand Slam&quot; bomb the most concentrated bundle of destruction previously known on this earth. In fact, in evaluating the enormous power involved in this new weapon, the President had to reach beyond the limits of the earth for comparison. &quot;It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe,&quot; he said. &quot;The force from which the sun draws its Dower has been loosed against those who brought wat to the Far East.&#039;.&#039; (The sun&#039;s energy Is produced by decomposition of atoms.) Warning Prepared by Churchill Issued This line appeared to hold dramatic possibilities for props.- props.- ganda against the Japanese. They regard their Emperor Hlrohito as a direct descendant of the sun goddess. Now they can be told that the very power of the sun itself is being turned to their destruction. Following the- the- announcement in Washington Prime Min ister Attlee issued in London a similar statement which had been prepared by former Prime Minister Churchill before he left office. &quot;It Is now for Japan to realize in the glare of the first atomic bomb which has smitten her,&quot; Churchill said, &quot;what the consequences will be of an Indefinite continuance of this terrible means of maintaining a rule of law in the world.&quot; The test of the highly secret weapon was carried out on the morning of July 16 In the New Mexico desert 120 miles southwest of Albuquerque. The flash was so brilliant that a blind girl In Albuquerque was reported to have exclaimed exclaimed &quot;What was that?&quot; The War Department said two men who were standing six miles away were blown down. President Truman, as he was nearlng American shores on the cruiser Augusta, homeward bound from the Potsdam Potsdam conference, and Secretary Stlmson worked together Turn to Page 2, Column 1 I-&#039; I-&#039; I-&#039; I</div>
