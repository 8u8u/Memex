## Vision & Mission

**Our vision** is a well informed, less polarised society that can make complex decisions effectively, sustainably and compassionately. 

**Our mission** is to help battle information overload by making it effortless for you and your peers to organise, share and discover the most useful and perspective rich content online.

## Our first product: Memex
A browser extension to eliminate time spent bookmarking, retracing steps to recall an old webpage, or copy-pasting notes into scattered documents.
Its name and functionalities are heavily inspired by [Vannevar Bush's vision of a Memex](http://memex.link/S1zVMgKzX/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).
